Ideas and Basics

Hello there. My name is Clyde and I'm an LGBTQ+ developer with an interest in game development and audio interfaces. Right now, I'm strengthening my skills and becoming a stronger developer before I tackle a semi-professional enviroment. 
I'm working mostly in C++ and develop mainly on a Linux computer. 
Bye!
